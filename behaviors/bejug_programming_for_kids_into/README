A behavior that I wrote to introduce a workshop about "Programming for Kids" 
at the Belgium Java User Group (BeJUG), 02/2012.

I used some pre-programmed behaviors (Thai Chi) and some self-made animations to 
present a project to an audience. Entirely made with Choregraphe, no additional 
Python scripts needed.

To start it, just load it and wait 10 seconds or say "explain".
